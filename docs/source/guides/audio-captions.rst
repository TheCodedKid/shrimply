Audio and Captions
==================

Captions
--------

Caption tracks store timed text independently from visual and audio tracks.
The inspector controls text, writing direction, layout, and appearance.
AppKit and GTK can export captions as YTT, ASS, SRT, VTT, or plain text (TXT).
TXT contains caption text without timestamps. See :doc:`export` for formatting
support and track export options.

Transcription
-------------

Transcription converts selected audio into timed text. The available model
catalog comes from the connected compute server, so start the server before
using transcription. See :doc:`../server/index`.

Text-to-speech and voice conversion
-----------------------------------

Audio tracks can contain generated speech. The compute server determines which
text-to-speech and voice-conversion models appear in Shrimply.

Lip sync expressions
--------------------

Expressions can call ``mouth()`` to match mouth shapes to the project audio or
selected audio tracks. See :doc:`lip-sync` for mouth shapes, selection syntax,
and analysis behavior.

Audio cleanup
-------------

Timeline actions can remove silence or export the audio for selected content.
Use audio modifiers for nondestructive cleanup and sound design within the
project.
